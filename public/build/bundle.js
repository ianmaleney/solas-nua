and listen to.</p> \n\n  <p><em>View Source</em> is a unique online publication, curated by Fallow Media\n    and commissioned by Solas Nua for this year’s St. Patrick’s Day, celebrating\n    contemporary Irish literature at its most adventurous. Working alongside six\n    cutting-edge literary publications in Ireland today –\n    <a href="https://stingingfly.org/" class="svelte-rte5hp">The Stinging Fly</a>,\n    <a href="https://thedublinreview.com/" class="svelte-rte5hp">The Dublin Review</a>,\n    <a href="http://gorse.ie/" class="svelte-rte5hp">Gorse</a>,\n    <a href="https://www.bansheelit.com/" class="svelte-rte5hp">Banshee</a>,\n    <a href="https://winterpapers.com/" class="svelte-rte5hp">Winter Papers</a>, and\n    <a href="https://fallowmedia.com/" class="svelte-rte5hp">Fallow Media</a> –\n    <em>View Source</em>\n    has invited writers and artists to reimagine stories, poems, and essays first\n    made available in print.</p> \n\n  <p>Taking advantage of the many possibilities of publishing on the internet,\n    <em>View Source</em> presents each text in multiple ways, giving visitors the\n    opportunity to choose how they want to experience each piece through unique on-screen\n    design, creative audio, or a print-at-home publication.</p> \n\n  <p>The temporary loss of bookstores and literary gatherings is just one of the\n    many changes wrought by the Covid-19 pandemic. <em>View Source</em> uses this\n    moment of confusion and crisis to ask what opportunities might lie hidden within\n    our global shift to online spaces. By publishing this work digitally, contemporary\n    Irish literature becomes accessible in new ways to new audiences, reaching people\n    who might never otherwise have access to it. So what could a book, a journal,\n    a story look like online? How might we use the specific strengths of the internet\n    to expand the literary text and break down the borders between different media?\n    Most importantly, how might readers discover new and meaningful connections to\n    this work?</p> \n\n  <p><em>View Source</em> brings together the talents of many contemporary Irish writers\n    and artists, including: Claire-Louise Bennett, Ruby Wallis, Doireann Ní Ghríofa,\n    Colm O&#39;Shea, Méabh de Brún, Nidhi Zak/Aria Eipe, Michael Dooley, Tom Rosingrave,\n    Maija Sofia, Vicky Langan and Louise Hegarty. Throughout the publication, the\n    finest writing blends with inventive audio and visual work to create a truly\n    special literary experience.</p> \n  <p>Kindly supported by Dennis Houlihan and Mimi Conway.</p> \n  <h3>About Fallow Media</h3> \n  <p>With the belief that the internet offers us critical and conceptual\n    approaches that remain largely unexplored in the worlds of literature, music\n    and the arts, Fallow Media has become an alternative space for contemporary\n    creativity in Ireland. Each project is a learning process, and an attempt to\n    share work from across the artistic spectrum in a new way. The hope is not\n    only to change the way people see this work, but also the way work is\n    created in the first place.</p>',N(o,"class","text")},m(e,t){ke(n,e,t),T(e,a,t),T(e,o,t),r=!0},p(e,[t]){},i(e){r||(ue(n.$$.fragment,e),Z((()=>{i&&i.end(1),s||(s=ge(o,ct,{delay:100,duration:800,amount:10,easing:t})),s.start()})),r=!0)},o(e){pe(n.$$.fragment,e),s&&s.invalidate(),i=fe(o,ct,{delay:0,duration:600,amount:10,easing:t}),r=!1},d(e){Ie(n,e),e&&$(a),e&&$(o),e&&i&&i.end()}}}function

A border is a line made by woman. A border\n      is not real. A border is an agreement that something unreal is real. A\n      border is an agreed exclusion. A border is a way of saying what is here\n      and what is there are different. A border is a way of describing a\n      difference.</p> \n    <p>It starts in the airport. It starts before the airport. It starts by not\n      saying, by not telling. It starts in the airport, looking around without\n      being seen to look around for faces who would not know why I am in the\n      airport. It’s about not being seen. It’s about making up excuses, making\n      up stories. It’s about being consistent in my stories. It’s about telling\n      people the same lie. It’s about knowing it’s best to tell one lie. It’s\n      about knowing that one lie is easier to remember, one lie is easier to not\n      trip over, one lie is less likely to be questioned if everyone believes it\n      to be true. It’s about lying about being somewhere else when you’re in an\n      airport.</p> \n    <p>She has to know where every border is. She can’t get caught. She can’t get\n      caught out. She has to know where everything stops and everything starts.\n      It’s a survival instinct. It’s automatic now. She has to read every\n      situation and know where she is. She has to know whether she’s crossed a\n      border and how to act. She has to know how near she is to a border, and\n      whether to turn and go back or prepare to cross over. She has to be\n      whatever is expected of her on any side of any border.</p> \n    <p>In a room listening to the artist Tamarin Norwood speak. I know the other\n      speakers but not her. That is, I’ve heard others mention her and her work,\n      but have never come across it until now. I strain to remember what is\n      being said, what she is saying. I know I will forget a lot of what she is\n      saying. I always do. I’m hoping someone is recording the event but I’ll\n      find out later that no one is. I won’t be the only one regretting that the\n      event isn’t being recorded.</p> \n    <p>A border is a boundary. A border is more than a line drawn in the sand. A\n      border is a line drawn to mean something more than a line. A border is\n      meant to say more about what is beyond the line, on either side. A border\n      becomes nothing when you see a border because a border is a line drawn and\n      a line drawn only has the thickness it has been given. A border drawn can\n      be reduced to nothing if you allow it because a line can be reduced to\n      nothing if you allow it, but a border is a shared belief that a line means\n      something.</p> \n    <p>Crossing the border doesn’t make it any easier. Crossing the border is\n      when real field craft comes into play. Crossing the border means there can\n      be no excuses, no stories, no lies. Getting caught crossing a border means\n      no escape. Even before the airport and the border it’s the messages and\n      the codes. It’s the letter drops and the fake names. It’s covering tracks.\n      Field craft teaches you that it’s easier to cover tracks before you’ve\n      even made them. It’s easier now and it’s harder. Different contacts,\n      different names, different addresses. Knowing who she is when she contacts\n      you even if the name isn’t your name for her. Knowing how to respond.\n      Knowing which questions are safe to ask and which will only cause trouble.\n      Field craft is knowing how much I can say without the risk of blowing her\n      cover, or mine.</p> \n    <p>A line means something. A line means direction. A line is a vector. A line\n      can be a vector but either side of a line is nothing unless you say it is\n      something, unless you agree it is something. A line becomes a border when\n      either side of the line means more than the line itself.</p> \n    <p>The first train is the greatest risk, it’s the greatest risk of being\n      spotted. I try to find a seat to stay inconspicuous but it’s standing room\n      only. It means I can watch the stations as we approach. It means I can\n      make a dash for the door before I’m spotted. It means I’m on edge the\n      entire time. Ignore what’s outside the windows. Don’t be a tourist, don’t\n      be a visitor. Blend in. Disappear. Be like everyone else. Glance at what\n      passes by the window the same way everyone else glances at what passes by\n      the window because we’ve all seen it a million times before. Don’t meet\n      anyone’s eyes, without meaning to not meet their eyes. Everyone else on\n      the train is a potential trap. Everyone else on the train could be the\n      cause of getting caught.</p> \n    <p>The room is full. I arrive early, earlier than I had planned, and take a\n      seat away from the door. Watch the room fill up. The rest of the audience\n      will know the other speakers, and her and her work, far better than I\n      will. I know I will paraphrase. I know I will misinterpret. I know I will\n      want to speak to her after the event but I will never get the chance. That\n      is, I will be sitting in the pub after the event with friends and she will\n      be sitting nearby with friends and I will mean to dip into her\n      conversation on the way out to tell her how interesting I found the\n      evening, hearing her speak, hearing her explain her work. But when the end\n      of the evening comes, when the end of my evening comes and I put my coat\n      on to leave, I say nothing to her.</p> \n    <p>She has to be invisible. She has to be discrete. She has to be at home\n      wherever she stands. She is a spy. She has to live as a spy. When she\n      speaks she has to know how to speak. When she speaks she has to know what\n      name to give and to stick with that name. The easiest way for a spy to\n      have their cover blown is to trip themselves up. Inconsistency means\n      death. She has to know where she is, stick to being whoever she is on that\n      side of that border and never waiver.</p> \n    <p>A place has no meaning without a border. A place is a space given a name\n      by a man. A place is a space given a name by a woman. A place has no\n      meaning without a border. A place is a nothing until it comes to an end;\n      otherwise it is just a nothing. A place has no meaning until it meets\n      another place. A place and a place only have meaning in themselves when\n      they meet. When two places meet and become something it is the border that\n      gives them meaning. So that means places have no meaning without a border\n      which has no meaning without it being given a meaning by a man or a woman,\n      by men or women.</p> \n    <p>I haven’t messaged her yet. I meant to before I left the airport but I\n      walked in the middle of a group all moving in the same direction. I’m less\n      likely to be picked out that way. I have my papers if needed but the less\n      chance I give them to ask me any questions the better my chances are. I\n      count the stations before I have to change trains. I don’t look up. I’m as\n      bored as everyone else beside me. I should message her. I look at my phone\n      but it’s as much to avoid looking up as anything else. I have no signal\n      but I know I’ll have a chance when I change trains. The platforms are\n      crowded but staying in the middle is the safest place of all. Changing\n      trains means emerging into the open air before going underground again.</p> \n    <p>Places have no meaning until they are given a meaning by giving them a\n      name. Nothing has a meaning until it is given a name. Nothing exists until\n      it is given a name. A butterfly does not exist until it is named. A\n      non-existent butterfly is free to cross a non-existent border. To name a\n      butterfly is to catch it. To catch a butterfly is to want to hold it in\n      your hands. To catch a butterfly is to risk crushing it. No butterfly\n      seeks out the net. A name is also a limit. A name is a limit given by\n      somebody else. A butterfly does not exist until it is captured and killed\n      and stuck to a board with a pin through its heart. Is a pin only a pin and\n      a butterfly only a butterfly when they come into contact? A butterfly only\n      has a name when a difference is defined between one butterfly and another.\n      A butterfly only exists when a line is drawn between one butterfly and\n      another. A butterfly only exists when a border is drawn between one\n      butterfly and another by a man or a woman. Metaphor is murder.</p> \n    <p>I message her to say I’m on my way. Nothing more. Nothing less. If they\n      know I’m here we’re caught anyway. If not it’s just the same message as\n      hundreds, if not thousands, are sending this moment across the city.\n      Changing trains means a safer train. I’m less likely to be spotted now.\n      Moving through a safer part of town. I take a seat, holding my bag in\n      front of me. I remember on a similar train with a larger bag accidentally\n      hitting a man across the shins. I apologised immediately but he continued\n      to wince and rub his leg for the rest of the journey. Today my bag is\n      smaller, less obtrusive. My bag is no bigger than many others I see around\n      me. My bag is easily forgettable. My bag is like me. A man and a bag on a\n      train going nowhere important. That’s all anyone will see.</p> \n    <p>A border is a line drawn but a line drawn can be changed. A border can be\n      changed. A difference can be changed. The difference between here and\n      there can be erased or revised by the erasure or revision of a border. The\n      definition of what is acceptable here and unacceptable there can be\n      redefined and redrawn like a border. A border has no meaning except for\n      that difference in meaning either side of it. A border is where someone\n      says no. A border is where a difference is applied. A border is where what\n      you do is not acceptable but what we do is.</p> \n    <p>She’ll pass by many names keeping her own locked safely in a box. To me\n      she’s Jane but she doesn’t go by that name with anybody else. Every time\n      she hears one of her names on a street or across a room she has to know\n      where she is and who she is this time. She can’t afford to have her cover\n      blown by answering a name she hasn’t been called. One doubt. One question\n      and she’s dead.</p> \n    <p>I look her work up afterwards to see if I get it right, if what I remember\n      is consistent with what she talks about and how she represents her work. I\n      will get it wrong. That is I listen to her speak and describe how she\n      works and what she is trying to do and I hear it in relation to this\n      piece. That is I have the germ of this piece in my head, a few scribbles\n      on pieces of paper I keep in my back pocket and swap from trousers to\n      trousers with a handkerchief as I add to them until I am ready to begin. I\n      hear her speak and watch her work on the screen and think of it in terms\n      of what is in my head. That means I will get it wrong. That means I will\n      misrepresent her and her work. That means I will regret that the event is\n      not recorded so at least there would be an accurate record of the artist\n      speaking that isn’t filtered through a different idea in my head.</p> \n    <p>There’s no reply from her. I don’t expect one. We’re underground now\n      anyway. She knows when I’m due to arrive. At the final station I wheel my\n      bag up the ramp and out onto the street. At the top of the ramp I move in\n      beside a wall and check my phone. Still nothing from her. A few other\n      passengers pass me by. One walks in the direction I’m going while the\n      others turn right and wait at the pedestrian crossing. It’s about\n      watching. Waiting I can see if I’m being followed. Waiting I can see if\n      they’re on to me. Nothing. Nothing from them and nothing from her.</p> \n    <p>She can only relax when she knows where she is. Enter a room, read a room,\n      watch. All the time watch without watching. Look without looking. Listen\n      without listening. Read without reading. All the time paying attention\n      without appearing to pay attention. All the time looking for that crack.\n      All the time looking for that one person with that one voice with that one\n      name looking for that one reaction that would blow her cover. Like the\n      time she was questioned in Buenos Aries. These were only casual questions.\n      These were only an effort to make conversation. These were just someone\n      trying to get to know her, maybe flirt a little, maybe ask her to dance or\n      have a drink. Innocent questions near the wrong ears. Innocent questions\n      near ears that shouldn’t have been listening to innocent questions.\n      Keeping her cover while answering innocent questions.</p> \n    <p>Borders exist because of force. Borders exist because of agreement.\n      Borders exist because of consent. A border is a line around a place. A\n      border is a line around a people. A border is a line around a person. To\n      cross a border around a place or a people is to consent to what is\n      acceptable within that border. To cross a border is to be told that what\n      is acceptable elsewhere is not acceptable here.</p> \n    <p>Her building is only a couple of minutes away. I should say nothing but I\n      message her again to say I’m at the station. I’m waiting for the all\n      clear. I’m waiting for her to say it’s safe to come up. I keep my head\n      down on the street. It’s too close and too late to have my cover blown\n      now. If they get me now they get us both. Still nothing from her. The\n      trick is to not stop now. The trick is to keep walking. The trick is to\n      make it look like my destination is still some way off. I pass her\n      building. If I look down one of the side streets I can see her door. If I\n      look up from her door I can see her window. I keep my head down. I keep\n      walking. I can walk around the block a few times until she says it’s safe,\n      until she’s ready for me to call. I guess the layout of the streets and\n      walk laps of her building, of her street. I glance behind me when I can to\n      check. Few people pass me. It’s a quiet day around this part of the city.</p> \n    <p>A border is a list of instructions. A border is a list of instructions on\n      how to live. A border is a list of instructions on how to act. To cross a\n      border is to accept that you will comply with the list of instructions\n      that is the border. To cross a border while paying lip service to the\n      border, to the list of instructions, is to be a spy. To be a spy is to\n      recognise that a border exists but to refuse to act as the border\n      requires. To cross a border as a spy is to risk being found out. To cross\n      a border as a spy is to live with the fear that you will be exposed as a\n      spy. To be exposed as a spy is to pay a heavy price. To be exposed as a\n      spy is to be exposed as someone who refuses to live by the list of\n      instructions that the border supplies.</p> \n    <p>Tamsin Norwood speaks about the point, the point of contact between a\n      stylus, a nib, and a page, between point and page. As she speaks a video\n      plays of one of her works. I will learn later it is called Keeping Time. I\n      will learn this while searching online to try to learn if what I remember\n      of the event and her work is accurate. The video shows the point of\n      contact between a pen and a page. The video follows the nib of the pen, of\n      two pens, or of one pen recorded twice, as it moves around a page, as it\n      makes a mark on the page. I watch the nib and the page. I watch the nib\n      moving around the page. I watch the mark it leaves on the page. I watch\n      what results from a nib and a page coming into contact.</p> \n    <p>The day hasn’t really begun around here. I could try to find a small café\n      and sit, and wait. But my inconspicuous bag on the train could become a\n      conspicuous bag now. Avoid shops. Avoid cafes. Avoid bars. Just keep\n      walking. I pass a woman walking a dog. Has she passed me before? Think.\n      Has she? Did I notice the dog the first time around and not her? Fuck.\n      Stupid, beginner’s mistake. Watch. That’s the whole thing, watch without\n      being seen to watch. I turn a corner and pass a school. Make a note. Don’t\n      pass this way again. You can pass an office building, a row of shops or\n      apartments or houses, or anywhere else more than once. But you can’t pass\n      a school for a second time. Walking past a school again attracts\n      questions. A man passing a school again wheeling a bag attracts attention,\n      attracts questions. A man passing a school again is a fool and deserves to\n      have his cover blown.</p> \n    <p>Borders exist within borders. A spy can live within a border and only\n      become a spy when they choose to disobey the list of instructions that the\n      border supplies. A spy can live their life without ever crossing the\n      border and becoming a spy. A spy does not have to act for anyone or\n      anything outside the border. A spy can be a spy for him or herself. A spy\n      does not have to be recruited. A spy does not have to be turned. A spy\n      does not have to be a spy on behalf of anyone else. A spy can choose to be\n      a spy for themselves and no one else. A border is a line made by man. A\n      border is a line made by woman. A spy can live within a border and choose\n      not to live as the border requires.</p> \n    <p>I want to message her again, I want to pass her building and pass her\n      door, pass under her window. I want to look up as I pass under her window\n      and see her watching for me. I check my phone. I check my phone again. I\n      walk and I check my phone. It’s late. She’s late. I try to avoid walking\n      up and down the same streets but I’m conscious of not walking too far from\n      her place in case she messages me and tells me to come up. Behind her\n      building a main road skirts the river. I could sit on a bench and look at\n      the river. A man wheeling a bag sitting on a bench looking at the river\n      won’t attract any attention. I only see one bench; a woman is feeding a\n      young child. I walk past them.</p> \n    <p>So easy to slip up. But she knows what she’s doing. She knows the game. It\n      becomes second nature for her to cover her tracks. It becomes second\n      nature to look over her shoulder without making it look like she’s looking\n      over her shoulder. It becomes second nature to check every street before\n      entering any door. Walking into a hotel or out of a bar. Putting on a hat\n      or adjusting a scarf. Fixing her gloves in the cold or fanning herself in\n      the heat. A nothing gesture by anybody else, an afterthought. Taking that\n      one small moment to look, to see, to watch.</p> \n    <p>Without the nib touching the page there is nothing. That is there is a nib\n      and there is a page. But a nib is something that makes a mark and a page\n      is something that receives and records the mark of a nib. So is a nib a\n      nib if it isn’t touching a page? Is a page a page if there is nothing\n      making contact with it leaving a mark? Is a nib only a nib and a page only\n      a page when they come into contact? Is all we know of their existence the\n      record of what happens when the nib and the page come into contact?</p> \n    <p>The list of instructions defined by a border can be more than the law. The\n      list of instructions defined by a border may never be written down. The\n      list of instructions defined by a border may require those living within\n      the border to live and act in a particular way different from those who\n      may live outside the border and those within the border will never be told\n      or never need to be told. The list of instructions provided by a border\n      can exist unwritten for generations and be followed by everyone within the\n      border automatically. The list of instructions provided by a border define\n      a way to act that complies with the wishes of the border. The list of\n      instructions provided by a border define a way to act that complies with\n      the wishes of the border as defined by those within the border who drew\n      the line to form the border.</p> \n    <p>Did she get my message? Did she have to go out? Did something come up? Did\n      someone call? Can she answer my message? I picture someone calling and\n      taking up her time. I picture her trying to act normally and being polite\n      while the light flashes on her phone indicating my message. I picture her\n      trying to get her caller to leave, to find an excuse to check her phone\n      and message me to call later. I picture her trying to find a way to let me\n      know it’s not safe. I picture all the things that can go wrong but my\n      phone buzzes and she says to come up. At this point I just turn back on\n      myself. I don’t care. I have my phone in my hand so if I’m stopped, if I’m\n      questioned I can just say there’s been a change of plans and I have to go\n      in this direction instead of the other. I form a response to the question\n      but there’s no one there to ask me.</p> \n    <p>When she walks she leaves no footprints. Nothing to say she was there.\n      Leaving every room is a meticulous operation. Checking out. Empty the\n      bathroom of every trace. Everything back in the bag. Everything in its\n      place. Leave nothing, forget nothing. No sign. No trace left behind. The\n      time she forgot a purse and panicked all the way to the airport. Relaxing\n      only when I went back to collect it. Remembering to give a different name.</p> \n    <p>A border defines a way to act. A border defines a way to live. A border\n      defines what is the correct way to live and what is incorrect. A border is\n      nodding approval. A border is exposure and censure for those who\n      transgress the border. A border is ruin for those who transgress the\n      border. A spy lives within a border but chooses not to obey the border. A\n      spy does not ignore a border; to ignore a border is to risk exposure for\n      transgression of the border. A spy knows the border and respects the\n      border. A spy respects what a border can do. A spy lives his or her life\n      in constant awareness of the border. A spy lives his or her life in\n      constant awareness of what the border can do.</p> \n    <p>If I’m spotted from a building, if I’m watched from a building it’s too\n      late anyway. If I’m recorded turning into the side street by the side of\n      her building it’s too late anyway. If someone is going to see me, if\n      someone is going to say or do anything it will be now. I approach her\n      door. I look up at her window. Even when I’m close enough I see nothing in\n      her window, nothing that isn’t in every other window. There’s a desk\n      inside the door of her building but it’s unmanned. Nobody there. Nobody in\n      the hallway. Nobody in the lift. Nobody in the corridor on her floor.\n      Looking left and right at her door. Knocking gently. Hearing nothing from\n      any of the doors I pass. Hearing nothing from the corridor behind or in\n      front of me. Hearing nothing but the lift moving on, up or down.</p> \n    <p>Learning to contact her. Learning the dead letter drops. Learning the code\n      words. Learning the fake names and the real names. Learning to communicate\n      with a spy means learning to become a spy yourself. Learning to embrace\n      the game. Learning that if your cover is blown she will disappear to avoid\n      the risk of being blown herself. Learning to learn. Learning what you can\n      leave behind. Learning what is and isn’t important. Learning that it may\n      be important now but if it risks her cover being blown she will abandon it\n      without looking back. Learning that security is everything.</p> \n    <p>A spy chooses to transgress a border because a spy chooses to live outside\n      of the list of instructions provided by a border. A spy learns quickly how\n      to act to avoid suspicion. A spy learns quickly or a spy is exposed. An\n      exposed spy is a lost spy. An exposed spy is a blown spy. A blown spy is\n      lost. A spy learns to live outwardly as if they respect and obey\n      everything that the border requires. A spy lives from safehouse to\n      safehouse. A safehouse is a space a spy defines that is inside a border\n      but outside the world of the border. A safehouse is defined by a line\n      drawn by a spy. A safehouse is defined by a border drawn by a spy. Within\n      the border of a safehouse a spy lives and acts as they choose.</p> \n    <p>Hearing nothing but her singing. Hearing nothing but her undoing the chain\n      and the door opening. She’s singing gently as the door opens. She stands\n      behind the door as I step through so the first time I see her is when she\n      closes the door behind me. Seeing her in the dim light of the hallway and\n      putting my arms around her. First, gentle kiss. First gentle kiss of being\n      here. First gentle kiss of being safe.</p> \n    <p>She gauges every story. What to tell and what not to tell. Which names to\n      change and which to leave in. Which names to just omit all together and\n      just tell a story about a friend. She knows how to tell any story in a way\n      that barely leaves any traces. She knows who she has told and what she has\n      told them. She knows who she has told and who she hasn’t. She knows how to\n      pick up different conversations at just the right point so they look like\n      the only conversations in the world.</p> \n    <p>The door is the line we draw between us and the rest. The door is the line\n      we draw to say we are here and everything else is excluded. The door is\n      the border we close. The door is our border, meaning we and only we make\n      the laws here, we decide what is right and what is wrong. We decide how we\n      should act and we decide to exclude everyone else who says otherwise.</p> \n    <p>I think about borders. I think about boundaries. I think about edges. I\n      think about the idea that things only come into existence when they come\n      into contact with another. I follow the nib moving over the page leaving\n      its mark and I see the mark as the only record of its existence. At one\n      point Tamarin Norwood describes taking a pen and marking a border around\n      the inside of a house she and her husband had just vacated because they\n      were moving somewhere else. I don’t know if she means to mention this\n      event as part of her talk or just chooses to include it as an anecdote\n      supporting her overall fascination with the point of contact between a nib\n      and a page. By drawing a line she is drawing a border. By drawing a border\n      around the interior of every room is she creating the room? By drawing a\n      border is she describing that this room, this house, is now different from\n      what is outside the border? By drawing this line, this border, is what is\n      inside this border something else? By drawing this border is she saying\n      that this house was not a house, it was a home? By drawing this border is\n      she saying that this house is now different from all the other houses\n      outside the border because they are just houses and this was a home?</p> \n    <p>Checking herself when she crosses a border she files away anything she\n      won’t need, any stories she won’t need. Every spy operates in a cell of\n      their own. Every spy operates without wires. Every spy has a safehouse.\n      Knowing what to leave in a safehouse and what to leave elsewhere. Knowing\n      who to tell about the safehouse and who to never let know it even exists.\n      Looking at a face and deciding in an instant how much to tell them.\n      Looking at a face and deciding in an instant that they will learn nothing.\n      Taking a circuitous route back to the safehouse. Making it look like there\n      is no safehouse. Allowing me into the safehouse.</p> \n    <p>I tell stories. She sings. I put on some music and we dance. We kiss. She\n      makes a meal. I watch and offer to help. We sit on the couch in each\n      other’s arms. We watch the day darken and end outside. We draw the\n      curtains before turning on a light. She tells me stories. We kiss. Share\n      the bathroom washing our teeth. We have drawn our border and now this\n      place is our country, our land. These rooms are our empire. The door with\n      the chain drawn is our border we’ve closed. We touch as we pass cleaning\n      up glasses and rinsing plates. We undress and slip beneath the covers. We\n      decree that it is too cold outside of the bed for either of us to leave.\n      This is our country and these are our laws. The line we have drawn is the\n      only line that matters. We make love and feed off the heat of each other.\n      Behind our closed border the only currency is the heat of our bodies. The\n      only language is touch and kiss.</p> \n    <p>I know I could be getting her work very wrong. I know if I ask her and\n      suggest what I think as I listen to her speak and watch the video of her\n      work and consider her story that I could be getting everything wrong, very\n      wrong. I know this and I know that by asking her she will explain where I\n      am going wrong. But as I choose to not talk to her in the pub after the\n      event, as I choose not to ask her I know I will probably never know. So I\n      will keep my wrongness, in whatever shape it may be.</p> \n    <p>Knowing what is out there about her. Making sure she leaves no traces. No\n      breadcrumbs to follow. Like the time, horse riding in the hills above the\n      city. Pretending to the guide that phones had been forgotten and left back\n      in the car so she couldn’t take a photograph. Knowing just what to say to\n      make sure she leaves no footprints. Knowing how cautious she has to be\n      because she knows what will happen if she gets caught. She knows the\n      penalty for being a spy. She knows the price she would pay. Knowing the\n      risk. Knowing the reward. She is a spy but she crosses the border for me.</p> \n    <p>The enemy of every border is time. Time erodes and erases borders. Borders\n      that stand for millennia disappear in an instant. Borders that stand and\n      repel invaders for generations eventually fall over nothing. The enemy is\n      time. We make love in the morning to feed our border. We eat breakfast and\n      shower and return to bed to make love to keep our border intact. But time\n      is the enemy. Time is the enemy and our border cannot hold. Time is the\n      enemy and our border crumbles and I have to go.</p> \n    <p>The door is just a door now. The chain is just a chain. The corridor\n      outside is the same corridor as it was before it was a border post. We\n      kiss before I pass through the door, we kiss before I cross what is left\n      of the border. We kiss and I promise to message her as soon as I get home.\n      We kiss and we already make plans to declare our own country again. There\n      will be walls. There will be dogs and searchlights. There will be other\n      borders to cross and lies to keep. There will be codes and secret\n      messages, checking for watchers and disappearing in plain sight. But we\n      will draw our line. We will make our border again and stake out our own\n      land. We will close a door and seal it with a line and ward off the world.</p> \n    <p><br/></p> \n    <p style="text-align: center">⁙</p>',p=_(),m=A("div"),m.innerHTML='<p><em>Butterfly</em>, written by , was first published in\n    <a href="http://gorse.ie"><em>gorse</em></a>.</p> \n  <p>Colm O&#39;Shea&#39;s short fiction has appeared in <em>gorse</em>,\n    <em>The Stinging Fly</em>,\n    <em>3AM Magazine</em>, <em>Hotel</em>, Fallow Media, Juxta Press,\n    <em>The Bohemyth</em>, and <em>Visual Verse</em>.

My husband’s father agreed to lend us the\n    twenty-five-year-old campervan he had recently purchased. For an uncertain\n    number of months its three beds, chemical toilet, two-ring gas hob,\n    child-sized sink and mini-fridge would accommodate the six of us.</p> \n  <p>We did our best to adapt. I took to loitering in the schoolyard long after\n    everyone else had left, so the children could play and shout and run. My\n    husband hauled our ancient washing machine onto a table in the garage and\n    improvised a rickety slide from old gutters and twine, rollercoastering suds\n    out to the drain. The van’s side window, slightly ajar, became our\n    letterbox; we thanked the postman through mouthfuls of cereal. I grew used\n    to fetching water from the fresh-water pipe that lay in the gravel outside,\n    but not to the stiff valve that always sprayed my shins, nor to the grit\n    that inevitably found its way into my coffee. It’s only for a few months, we\n    said, as the six of us showered in a local gym. Any time a cheap Airbnb\n    became available within a ninety-minute drive, we hurried to its heaters,\n    oven dinners and hot water – but such occasions were rare, and winter was\n    approaching.</p> \n  <p>It grew cold. Storm clouds gathered; the van flinched from the gales. I\n    flinched too. No matter how long I bent over that small sink, scrubbing,\n    always scrubbing, our belongings felt grimy. If two of us stood upright at\n    once, the van felt intolerably crowded. I didn’t scream, but I often wanted\n    to. When I dug out our box of hats and gloves, I held the familiar darkness\n    of my favourite scarf to my face, inhaling deeply. It smelled like home. I\n    began to wear it all the time, taking it off only while I slept.</p> \n  <div class="window svelte-fwbeod"><div class="pane svelte-fwbeod"></div></div> \n  <p>An invitation to spend the Halloween midterm at a friend’s empty cottage in\n    Mayo seemed too good to be true: a week of warm beds would be luxurious, not\n    to mention a dishwasher. There was something else, too: a half-remembered\n    family myth from Mayo. Stray threads began to come back to me as we drove\n    the tunnel deep under the Shannon. My young great-grandfather on the run;\n    soldiers surrounding a church while he was at mass; and his escape disguised\n    as a woman.</p> \n  <p>In Clare we paused for lunch at my parents’ home. While the children\n    squabbled over pizza, I poked through bookshelves until I found what I was\n    looking for. The first folder had been compiled by my grandfather and\n    incorporated reminiscences of his own youth, a vast family tree, and\n    recollections of his father, Pádhraic Ó Gabhláin. Pádhraic was the subject\n    of the second folder too, a college project submitted by my mother as part\n    of her teacher training. This included an appendix of photocopied sources:\n    handwritten letters, old maps, obituaries, and copies of articles from the <em>Freeman’s Journal</em>, <em>An Claidheamh Solais</em>, the <em>Western People</em>, and the\n    <em>Irish Independent</em>. Having little time before we had to get back on\n    the road, I flicked through the obituaries until I found a trace of the\n    story I sought, documented in newsprint by his friend Aodh Ó Nualláin. The\n    obituary described events that had occurred one Sunday at Aghamore church in\n    east Mayo during the War of Independence, when ‘a company of military\n    arrived and surrounded the church’. Pádhraic – a member of what was\n    initially known as the Irish Volunteers and later as the IRA –</p> \n  <blockquote>by dressing as a woman and walking out of the church with as much dignity as\n    possible among the women members of the congregation. Apparently there was\n    some delay in getting the proper fit in clothes and shoes, but the celebrant\n    of the mass, the late Reverend Father Garvey, was a staunch Republican, and\n    many in the congregation noticed that on that particular Sunday the prayers\n    after mass were unusually long.</blockquote> \n  <p>I wanted to know more, but it was nearly time to leave. I made a quick run\n    to the copy-shop and then hurried the folders back to the shelf.</p> \n  <p>As we drove onwards to Mayo, I held my photocopies close. It was dark by the\n    time we found our way to the cottage, unpacked, and put the children to bed.\n    I poured a glass of wine, opened the documents, and began at the beginning.</p> \n  <p>Born in 1892, Pádhraic left primary schooling to work on local farms and\n    bogs, travelling alongside his neighbours to labour seasonally in England.\n    This cluster of families had worked side by side for generations – the\n    Bolands, Greallys, Spellmans, and Forkans had been neighbours since\n    pre-Famine times, my grandfather wrote, their names marked on landlord’s\n    maps ‘of linen in Indian ink and watercolour with lists of tenants and\n    holdings’. He and his best friend Hugh Nolan (who, decades later, would sign\n    his obituary as Aodh Ó Nualláin) were sometimes overheard chatting about\n    characters from Dickens in terms so familiar that passers-by presumed they\n    were speaking of locals. Together, they started a pamphlet that was posted\n    from house to house, with each recipient filling an empty page with a new\n    story.</p> \n  <p>The 1911 census noted that Pádhraic’s parents spoke both Irish and English,\n    whereas he and his siblings spoke English only. There, he was documented\n    under the name he grew up with: Patrick Forkan. Shortly thereafter, in his\n    early twenties, he and some friends were chatting by the roadside when a\n    passing teacher greeted the group casually in Irish. My great grandfather\n    felt such shame at his inability to reply that he began to attend Irish\n    classes. He quickly took to the language. Such was the demand among young\n    people wishing to do likewise at that time that anyone who had gained a\n    minimal fluency in Irish was asked to volunteer to instruct new students. In\n    those slapdash classrooms he found his vocation; and henceforth he always\n    used the Irish form of his name. Teaching was to become what Ó Nualláin’s\n    obituary described as ‘the pleasure of his life’. Beyond those classes, his\n    days were spent in farmwork, reading, and writing.</p> \n  <p>By April 1917 Pádhraic was secretary of a local branch of Conradh na Gaeilge\n    and had established a company of the Irish Volunteers in Crossard.\n    Photographed at the Sinn Féin ardfheis with neat tie, crisp collar, and hair\n    swept to the side, he smiled with earnest eyes. He did not know what was to\n    come. No one did. I found that my own grasp of what was to come was lacking\n    too, so I turned to the internet to fill the gaps in my knowledge of the War\n    of Independence. By 1920, I read, attacks on the constabulary were growing\n    so common all over the country that supplementary forces were deployed. So\n    many of the Black and Tans and Auxiliaries arriving in Ballyhaunis had\n    fought in the First World War that the area in which they were billeted was\n    nicknamed ‘The Dardanelles’. Incidents of cruelty, drunken violence and\n    torture were soon reported across Mayo. In response, local resistance groups\n    grew, companies of the Irish Volunteers proliferated, and both ambushes and\n    retaliatory acts of violence intensified.</p> \n  <p>Ó Nualláin noted that Pádhraic took a very active part in the organisation\n    of the Ballyhaunis Battalion, a fact that was apparently noticed by the\n    Occupation Forces of the area, for from early in the troubled times he\n    seemed to have attracted their particular attention. From documents captured\n    by the Dublin brigade and forwarded to the local volunteers it became clear\n    that he was a marked man, and he was obliged to go ‘on the run’ and remain\n    constantly on the alert.</p> \n  <p>The next morning, I cleared the children’s breakfast bowls from the table\n    and searched groggily through the online archives of the Bureau of Military\n    History, hoping to find Pádhraic’s story recounted in his own words; but it\n    seems he did not provide testimony to the Bureau. I did find his name in\n    documentation from the Military Service Pensions Collection, dated 1935, in\n    which those who fought in Mayo battalions were listed retrospectively. His\n    name is among those recalled by Captain Seán Carney, who listed him as\n    Patrick Forkan of the 2nd Western Division, I Brigade (South Mayo), 5th\n    Battalion, B Company. Many of the surnames my grandfather had noted on local\n    pre-Famine maps were also listed in this company, suggesting that he was\n    among friends and neighbours.</p> \n  <p>In the absence of a description in my great-grandfather’s own words, I\n    sought out accounts by the others. Ernie O’Malley’s oral history of the War\n    of Independence in Mayo was available online, and there I read how Johnny\n    Greally – a man who was born, grew up, lived, and fought by Pádhraic’s side\n    – described the day their commanding officer, Seán Corcoran, was murdered:</p> \n  <blockquote>We heard that Curley’s house was to be burned, and we went to get rifles to\n    defend it. Seán and Maurice Mullins were supposed to call at this house, but\n    when he was coming over Seán ran into a patrol of Tans. His revolver jammed\n    at the first shot and he was shot dead, and Maurice, who was unarmed, was\n    beaten almost to death. They beat him there and they threw him in on top of\n    the dead Seán Corcoran in the turf house of the Barracks.</blockquote> \n  <p>Later that day, a sniper shot one of the Black and Tans in retaliation. As\n    vengeance, the Black and Tans murdered a local man named Michael Coen,\n    mutilating his corpse: ‘they cut off his private parts and pinned them on\n    his breast, and they cut the flesh of his legs and arms. They cut off his\n    ears and left him out on the road. They were night and day in that area in\n    Crossard townland, searching, for they must have had information. [...] The\n    people stiffened their resistance.’</p> \n  <p>I do not know what part, if any, Pádhraic played in the events of that day,\n    but Greally’s account allowed me a glimpse of the environment in which he\n    was engaged. Pádhraic was one of many who survived by stealth in those\n    years, hurrying from safe-house to safe-house. His continued evasion of the\n    Black and Tans became a source of local bafflement. Ó Nualláin writes:</p> \n  <blockquote>In spite of the special enemy attention he took part in all the activities\n    of the area and was never captured, although his many hairbreadth escapes\n    made him almost a legendary figure in his native district. On one occasion\n    when visiting his own home he was suddenly told that a large force of police\n    and military were surrounding the house. He slipped out, however, and\n    although the enemy opened fire, his knowledge of the country enabled him to\n    escape.</blockquote> \n  <p>Greally explained to Ernie O’Malley that their small group ‘had no arms save\n    shotguns. There were a couple of rifles but you couldn’t be sure of them. We\n    fired off ammunition from Seán Corcoran’s rifles, but only an odd round went\n    off. We had very few short arms.’ The best resource at their disposal was\n    the goodwill offered by neighbours, whether through shelter or sustenance.</p> \n  <p>Within a month of Corcoran and Coen’s deaths, I read, the men found\n    themselves in peril again, having been traced to a remote area of bogland.\n    Greally described how the Black and Tans had information that we would be in\n    the bog, the six of us, myself and Paddy Boland, the company O/C, Pádhraic\n    Forkan, a Gaelic teacher, Austin Kenny and Jim Kilkelly. They wanted these\n    six of us. We were in a neighbour’s house where we used to stay, when Paddy\n    Mullins, the Brigadier, sent over bombs with me. The Master sent word to us\n    by a young lad, who came across the fields, and we had just time to get out.\n    They, the soldiers, fired shots, and they went into the house again, and\n    they bayoneted poor Paddy Boland who was an only son. They bursted the\n    bayonet in him and they almost cut his nose off with a bayonet also.</p> \n  <p>The neighbour in whose house they had sheltered was my\n    great-great-grandmother: Pádhraic would marry her daughter. I remembered her\n    from a section of my grandfather’s reminiscences I’d read the night before,\n    a memorable passage that skipped from amusement to dread within a single\n    paragraph: My grandmother looked like a grandmother. She was fat and\n    comfortable and dressed in black. [...] She said very little about ‘the\n    troubles’. The only thing I remember was her account of the day when Paddy\n    Boland was shot. ‘The boys’ had run from her house as the troops approached\n    and scattered across the bog. Paddy Boland was shot dead a few hundred yards\n    from the house. She watched from a window as his body was carried on an\n    improvised stretcher covered in a blanket. It was only when she could see\n    the boots that she knew it was not one of her own sons.</p> \n  <p>The date of Pádhraic’s escape from Aghamore church is not recorded in any\n    document I have seen; all we know for sure is that it must have happened\n    during the year and a half between the arrival of the Black and Tans in\n    Ireland, at the beginning of 1920, and the truce that was agreed in the\n    summer of 1921.</p> \n  <p>After the truce, and the treaty, and the split in the republican movement,\n    Pádhraic couldn’t bring himself to participate in the civil war that com\n    menced in the summer of 1922. Another obituary, by C. Caimbhéal, noted that\n    ‘He was a respecter of valour and worth in any who had shown faith in their\n    cause. I recall his yearly buying of poppies from an ex-army captain on\n    Armistice Day. He was no bigot.’ He married. He wrote. He worked. His\n    children were born. He returned to his beloved books. He secured a job at\n    Ballyhaunis Vocational School, and filled his summers with further teaching\n    at Coláiste Chonnacht, in the heartlands of Conamara. He loved to read, to\n    write, to teach, and to laugh.</p> \n  <p>My grandfather noted that ‘a straightforward description of my father’s\n    subsequent career might make him sound like a worthy, earnest and dull\n    character. This is as far from the truth as could be. One of the most\n    obvious things about him was his sense of humour – wild, anarchical humour\n    in his youth; warm and witty in his later years and never fully subdued by\n    old age.’ Reading this line, I wished that I could have heard him laugh.\n    When Pádhraic died in 1965, his coffin was draped in the tricolour, and his\n    surviving comrades, Johnny Greally among them, formed a guard of honour. A\n    passionate graveside oration was delivered by John P. Jordan. Of this\n    funeral, C. Caimbhéal wrote: ‘There were no tears on any face for it was the\n    honouring of a warrior, and none weep when a soldier sleeps when his fight\n    is over.’</p> \n  <p>After closing the folders and all the tabs on my phone, I couldn’t stop\n    thinking about what I’d read. I woke that night thinking of how the young\n    Pádhraic had sent his little pamphlets from house to house, always including\n    empty pages in which recipients could add a new story. So far, his son and\n    granddaughter and several obituarists had filled pages with their writings\n    on his life; perhaps I could add a page, too. ‘Cloch le carn’ is the phrase\n    used for the traditional act of adding one’s own stone to a cairn made in\n    memory of another. Rather than a cairn, however, I found myself thinking of\n    the story as a beloved scarf, a garment whose stitches I had already begun\n    to unpick into a soft mass of unravelled facts. As a girl, the story of his\n    escape from Aghamore church had seemed a neatly woven tale of adventure,\n    prudently tailored to a child’s ears: no torn flesh, no torture, no terror.\n    Now that the dark red of Greally’s voice had seeped in, however, there could\n    be no erasing it. I wondered what other threads might add themselves as I\n    set upon knitting my own telling of it.</p> \n  <p>It was this curiosity that led me to bring the whole family to the church at\n    Aghamore the following day. We are not a family of mass-goers, and I can’t\n    recall how I sold them on this road trip. As soon as we parked, I hurried\n    ahead, certain that I wouldn’t have much time before the kids lost patience,\n    before pausing in the porch, suddenly nervous. I would be alone, if only for\n    the length of time it took my husband to wrestle coats and hats onto our\n    children. A residual whiff of sanctity haunted the air. My breath was short\n    and growing shorter – I had wound my scarf too well, I realized, tucking a\n    finger between fabric and throat until it gave a little. I drank a deep\n    lungful and watched my breath hurry away, a small fog, or a ghost: glimpsed,\n    then gone. I pushed the door and stepped into the story.</p> \n  <p>The church was empty. I moved quickly up the aisle, snapshotting details on\n    my phone as I went: a statue, an altar cloth, a dent worn into the floor by\n    many decades of footfall. Outside, clouds broke and blew; when shards of\n    sunlight met stained-glass eyes, I wondered whether those glassy faces had\n    felt alive to my great-grandfather, too. Above my head, the intricately\n    crafted timber roof was neat as a ribcage. All his life, Pádhraic returned\n    to pray here, surrounding himself with the same people, all standing and\n    kneeling in unison, their voices murmuring a warm chorus around his.\n    Together and alone, they aged. Theirs were the eyes that met his in worship,\n    on feast days, at funerals and baptisms, on the day he escaped from the\n    Crown forces, and on his wedding day.</p> \n  <p>My children flung open the door and galloped toward me, raucous as ever,\n    with coats flapping open, hats and scarves forgotten, shouldering into each\n    other, giggling and squabbling, their cheeks already reddened by cold. I\n    rolled my eyes at my husband – it is a running joke between us that while I\n    mollycoddle the children with mittens and vests and thermal underwear, he\n    believes that a little cold will toughen them. Sitting in the pew with a\n    child on each knee and another in each elbow, I began to adjust the story\n    for their ears; but soon they were whingeing for the car. The only one who\n    insisted on staying was the boy who always stays by my side when I lead my\n    family on such jaunts, the child who at seven is skinny and bold and bright\n    and always fights to hold my hand. I continued to photograph the little\n    details that surrounded us, and that had once surrounded Pádhraic: the\n    dinged brass of the altar bells, the dark lustre of the confessional box,\n    the altar that had never figured in my imaginings until its inscription\n    loomed before me. Sanctus, Sanctus, Sanctus: a male figure was carved there,\n    each fold of his gown whittled from cold stone. Holy, Holy.</p> \n  <p>Only when my son whispered ‘I’m cold, Mám,’ did I notice that his coat had\n    been forgotten altogether. I was glad of the warmth my body had pressed into\n    the weft of my scarf as I wound it into a pullover of sorts, criss-crossing\n    its endings into his waistband: snug. I pressed my lips to his forehead and\n    on we went with my hand in his, or his in mine. When he asked what we were\n    looking for, I couldn’t answer because I didn’t know, beyond the sense that\n    he and I had entered the story, and now we had to find our way towards some\n    sort of an ending. Perhaps the gesture of leaving a little flame in our wake\n    might do it? No, all the wicks were unlit, and I could see no matches.</p> \n  <p>My son shrugged and asked me to finish telling the story, and I did, and was\n    surprised on approaching the ending to find myself saying, ‘and if it\n    weren’t for that moment, would we be here today, you and me?’</p> \n  <p>I was smiling as I turned towards the door, until my son broke away to dash\n    a giddy circuit of the room, hee-hawing the chorus of ‘Old Town Road’ and\n    cackling over his shoulder. From the porch I called to him in exasperation,\n    then called again, my voice growing colder now, cold and cranky. While I\n    waited, I lined up one last photo of the aisle, the door ajar to show its\n    neat symmetry of empty pews; but just as I got the framing right, my son\n    hurtled through the shot, blurring past me and sprinting out towards the\n    car. Little trespasser. I arranged the photo again, and then turned to catch\n    up with him. The door of the church thumped heavily behind us.</p> \n  <p>In the car, my husband was thumbing his phone and the children were munching\n    chocolate biscuits. I felt satisfied as I clicked my seatbelt – seeing this\n    place felt like some small achievement to show for our cold months away from\n    home. But back in the cottage, I couldn’t sleep for incessant fidgeting: the\n    story wouldn’t rest. If I couldn’t hear the story of this escape in\n    Pádhraic’s own voice, then maybe there was a way to hear it in the voice of\n    one who had stood by him. My mother had once heard a man on the radio\n    describe how, long ago, his grandmother had disguised a man at mass to save\n    him from the Black and Tans. She had made a note of the man’s name. Tadhg\n    Mac Dhonnagáin was a publisher of Irish-language books, and I knew him a\n    little from Twitter. He lived in Conamara, only an hour and a half or so\n    away. I found his email address. I told him that I wanted to know how this\n    story had been told in his childhood.</p> \n  <p>In the Buillín Blasta café in An Spidéal, Tadhg described his grandmother,\n    Annie Kenny: a bright young woman who had been awarded a teacher-training\n    scholarship in Belfast, but still travelled home at weekends to lead the\n    church choir. The story he had inherited began there, with a young woman\n    leading a chorus of voices, called to a sudden act of courage, then hurrying\n    to save a life. It was a tale he had treasured as a child, Tadhg said, and\n    he told it beautifully: Annie’s quick thinking, her gathering of garments,\n    her supervision of the disguise, her palms rubbing distemper from the walls\n    to press on Pádhraic’s cheeks. His favourite part of all, he said, was the\n    importance placed on one detail: the height of the women chosen to escort\n    him to safety. Those women: they were tall.</p> \n  <p>I thanked Tadhg for his time, wound myself back into my scarf and rummaged\n    my car keys from my handbag. Driving back to Mayo, between mountains and\n    bogs, over stone bridges and boreens, I pictured Annie on the church\n    mezzanine, her hair braided and pinned high, her face among the crowd in the\n    choir, alive and afraid. A wild, fearful whisper was flying through the\n    church below. She watched as one person whispered in dread to the next: they\n    were surrounded. The soldiers were outside with their guns.</p> \n  <p>When the whisper reached Pádhraic’s ear, I imagine that he sat in silence a\n    moment, assessing his predicament and that of the people around him. There\n    were elderly people present, women, and children. If he surrendered, might\n    others be spared?</p> \n  <p>The priest, knowing these soldiers as brutally violent and unpredictable,\n    bought time by lengthening the prayers. Annie hurried down from the choir\n    and gathered garments: a dark shawl here, a skirt there, perhaps a blouse.\n    Pádhraic was urged to his feet and dressed. Palms were pressed to damp\n    walls, and then to the shadow of his stubble. A black shawl was drawn over\n    the crest of his skull, quick as a shadow. The priest drew the prayers to\n    their end. The two tallest women stood by him, arm in arm, their trio folded\n    within the close crowd. Elbows trembled. Down the aisle they all went, out\n    the door, past the soldiers. Eyes lowered. Jaws tight. No flinching. A\n    procession of bodies leaving the church gates and walking steadily away:\n    almost an ordinary sight. On this Sunday, everyone leaves alive. The End.</p> \n  <p>Exhilarated and weary from driving, I fell into bed early, but my heart\n    raced, and my toes twitched: too much coffee. Eventually I fumbled my phone\n    from where it was charging on the floor and swiped idly through photos of\n    our trip: playgrounds, mountains, the gift of a barmbrack, Harry Clarke\n    windows in Ballinrobe, a little dog called Marcie. I came to the penultimate\n    photo I’d taken in the church, the one that had vexed me when my son flung\n    himself through it. I zoomed in by fingertip. There was the aisle, along\n    which a male shadow hurried. By the next photo the aisle was empty. How\n    brief, his presence: glimpsed, then gone. When I swiped back, though, he\n    reappeared, wrapped again in a borrowed shawl, folded into the fabric of\n    that inherited story – too big and too dark – in which we all find ourselves\n    bound by those who came before us.</p> \n  <p><br/></p> \n  <p style="text-align: center">⁙</p>',d=_(),c=A("div"),c.innerHTML='<p><em>A Scarf</em>, written by Doireann Ní Ghríofa, was first published in\n    <em><a href="https://thedublinreview.com/">The Dublin Review</a></em>.</p> \n  <p>Doireann Ní Ghríofa is a poet and essayist. <em>A Ghost in the Throat</em> was\n    awarded Book of the Year at the Irish Book Awards, and described as “glowing”\n    (Anne Enright), “spellbinding” (Joseph O’Connor), “gorgeous” (Lauren Elkin),\n    “captivatingly original”​​ (The Guardian), “sumptuous” (The Sunday Times), and\n    a “masterpiece” (Sunday Business Post).</p> \n  <p>Doireann is also author of six critically-acclaimed books of poetry, each a\n    deepening exploration of birth, death, desire, and domesticity.

However, the truth is altogether more worrying as the team\n    from <em>Prime Time Investigates</em> uncovered Monday night on RTÉ One. The\n    programme provided a rare insight into a people who have effectively closed\n    themselves off from the outside world. <br/>We are first introduced to\n    Mary, a pleasant woman in her late sixties who sees nothing wrong with the\n    hard work involved in washing, cleaning and cooking without electricity. She\n    says she was raised to work hard, and she sees no problem with it. We\n    subsequently join local men at a pub where they sing songs and tell stories\n    and create their own entertainment. They speak in an odd, old-fashioned\n    dialect that marks them out as different. It is a quaint kind of life and\n    one that looks appealingly nostalgic until we meet Neasa.\n    <br/>Neasa grew up in the village and was subject to physical abuse at the\n    hands of her family. She escaped when she was 18 and has never returned. For\n    her it is not just about the electricity, she explains, the darkness is a\n    form of control. The village does not allow strangers to stay long and they\n    do not respect the authority of the Gardaí or the State.
