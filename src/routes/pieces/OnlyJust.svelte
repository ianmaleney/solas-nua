  <p>I look around my flat and I see boxes, dozens of boxes</p>
  <p>Ϸ</p>
  <p>
    The first morning of the world is brilliant and sparkly, dazzled by its own
    newness. All of creation awaits their naming. A hush falls – the bated
    breath of the divine – and a box is opened. From it emerge cacophonous
    sounds: of a storm, or a stirred hornet’s nest, of chaos and catastrophe.
    With that first peek into unforeseeable contents, the infancy of humanity
    ceases
  </p>
  <p>ϧ</p>
  <p>
    Adventurers leave their homes, which made them, to find these unmapped
    places and face dragons and monsters – they face their own fear
  </p>
  <p>Ϣ</p>
  <p>
    I had Pandora in my head so I started to wonder if she had a box. And if she
    did what colour it might be. I decided pink like her cardigan. And gave it
    flaps
  </p>
  <p>Ϙ</p>
  <p>
    God knows why, but a whirlwind of purple smoke engulfing a landscape which
    settles over everything – grassland, houses and hills
  </p>
  <p>Φ</p>
  <p>
    I remember the first time I heard the term Pandora’s Box, I was pretty
    young, and someone, I can’t remember who now, said it to me sort of vaguely,
    we were both standing on a log in the countryside somewhere
  </p>
  <p>Ϸ</p>
  <p>Who opened the box, releasing negative forces into the world?</p>
  <p>Ϯ</p>
  <p>
    It’s the Ark of Covenant stored away in a warehouse. It’s in the box at the
    very back of the top of the wardrobe in your parent’s bedroom. It’s what
    Freud would say about that. It’s Tutankhamun’s tomb. It’s a bunker in
    Switzerland
  </p>
  <p>ω</p>
  <p>
    All the gifts Zeus never wanted, he put in the box he gave to you Along with
    the blame passed on to you, the woman, created for the task, by a male
    pantheon
  </p>
  <p>ͽ</p>
  <p>Some things you should not look at because they ruin your happiness</p>
  <p>π</p>
  <p>
    And that’s what it is isn’t it? Another of these classic myths that through
    the centuries of sexism boils down to ‘curious lady dooms humanity’. Cursed
    be she who questions the imposed order even if it doesn’t really make a lick
    of sense
  </p>
  <p>α</p>
  <p>
    Pandora, Cassandra, Jocasta, Medea. We know them but we don’t know how we
    know them. But we intuit that somehow they are bad…else their names would
    not still live
  </p>
  <p>Ж</p>
  <p>
    I am not familiar with the myth I am aware that Pandora was depicted as a
    beautiful woman. I learned this from reading The Beauty Myth by Naomi Wolf
  </p>
  <p>Ђ</p>
  <p>
    I’d like to associate that box with the hope that Pandora finds at the
    bottom of the box once all the rage and jealousy and disease has made its
    escape Ϯ My question is, why was this box so easily opened in the first
    place? It seems to be a bit of a setup. If you want to keep your afflictions
    locked up, perhaps it’s better to find something less accessible? Ќ It
    evokes memories of the imagination that I had, for I believed that the box
    contained pretty jewels and things of great Beauty, that Pandora could
    perhaps open the box and find whatever she was looking for, anything at all
  </p>
  <p>Ђ</p>
  <p>
    Pandora’s box has a magical quality and always has had from when I was a
    child
  </p>
  <p>Φ</p>
  <p>
    I always found something about the words Pandora’s box a bit irritating,
    maybe I don’t like the name Pandora, or else I’m irritated by the vagueness
    of the possibilities of what it means
  </p>
  <p>Ж</p>
  <p>
    I remember when I read that book thinking, why is it always women who are
    depicted as wreaking disaster – Eve in the bible for instance – when in fact
    decisions made by men have caused more sorrow and pain to humanity than
    women α When she opens her legs – annihilation
  </p>
  <p>Ϗ</p>
  <p>
    I used to wish that I could fix all problems and it took the form of a pair
    of trousers with a huge pocket in which there were tools and literally
    anything that someone else needed – to make them happy – and that I could do
    this. I didn’t call them my Pandora Pantalones but they could have been that
  </p>
  <p>Ϩ</p>
  <p>
    When I think of Pandora’s Box I don’t think of the myth, I think of the
    iconic silent film from the 1920s. In my mind’s eye I see Lulu peering out
    from her monochrome screen world
  </p>
  <p>Ϭ</p>
  <p>A disruption in the façade of the normal</p>
  <p>Ͼ</p>
  <p>Berlin, Mexico City, London</p>
  <p>Ќ</p>
  <p>
    A Myth to my young mind was little more than a fairy story, a story which I
    changed to make me feel happy whenever I thought about it
  </p>

  <p>She is disarmingly naive when she’s not being entirely calculating</p>
  <p>Ϗ</p>
  <p>I know, but only just, that the box is meant to spill out problems</p>
  <p>ͽ</p>
  <p>
    My daughter Emer when asked about Pandora’s Box told me it is an online shop
    where she buys very pretty jewellery
  </p>
  <p>α</p>
  <p>
    For me the whiff of evil power associated with Pandora still sticks to those
    bracelets even though they are marketed as the exact opposite – girlie,
    desirable, collectable. I like when I catch a glimpse of one on the wrist of
    my niece. Hahaha, I think, you’re out of your box!
  </p>
  <p>Φ</p>
  <p>
    I wonder about Pandora, who she was, was she young or old, and just what she
    opened up for herself and the world. I wonder whether she was punished for
    opening the box, or did she thrive from the wonders and lessons that the box
    opened, were they positive or negative lessons? Was she sorry she opened it?
  </p>
  <p>Ϩ</p>
  <p>
    Lulu is a simmering, smoldering, sexy, celluloid, screen siren. She is the
    embodiment of 1920s glamour with her slinky black bob, flashing eyes and
    carefree smile. But Lulu is a world of trouble
  </p>
  <p>Д</p>
  <p>
    Pandora is misunderstood and it’s not Pandora’s shop on Shop Street as my
    husband thinks
  </p>
  <p>Ϣ</p>
  <p>
    As silky as a slinky snake She won’t be boxed In the next frame, she is home
    feet up, tea cupped, in a soothing ritual of rest

    Men lose their minds, their willpower, their morals when they are around her

    If you find you don’t care for this binary, could you accept that we already
    contain everything?
  </p>
  <p>Д</p>
  <p>
    She is the rebellious disobedient one and someone to fear. She looked at her
    lovers head on you see. You look at her when she enters a room π I think an
    apt update would be lazy entitled bigoted man doesn’t just open the box – he
    has the power to close it but chooses not to because it might slightly
    inconvenience him and besides – I mean – couldn’t he use all the chaos
    caused by these plagues or scourges or whatever to his own benefit?
  </p>
  <p>ϧ</p>
  <p>
    Pandora’s box immediately makes me think of opening the door of a strange
    dark room
  </p>
  <p>Ϙ</p>
  <p>
    A feeling of anticipation, excitement and wonder of the power within. A
    temptation with a fear of something prohibited and irreversible
  </p>
  <p>Ͼ</p>
  <p>
    You could say these unopened boxes are the ‘what ifs’ in my life. An
    arrangement of ‘what ifs’ arising from a fear of not being able to return
    the contents to their place. And so I keep them tightly shut, carrying them
    from home to home, unopened boxes multiplying on the coffee table
  </p>
  <p>Φ</p>
  <p>
    There was a very particular time in my life when the description opening
    Pandora’s box fits perfectly. I’m not sure if there is an adequate word to
    describe the profound experiences that opened up and I was absolutely
    unready for. I longed to return back to the time before it all kicked off,
    but I couldn’t, and I’ll never forget the moment that I realised that I
    could never go back to the way I was before
  </p>
  <p>ϧ</p>
  <p>
    This analogy of the dark room, uncertain ground, is something I have used to
    describe what it’s like to venture into a new part of my psyche or emotional
    being, testing out new areas of feeling which are not straightforward or
    pleasant – it can be frightening, like looking into the abyss
  </p>
  <p>Ќ</p>
  <p>
    I was eventually to find out that my version belied the Myth surrounding
    Pandora’s box, I found this entirely unsatisfactory
  </p>
  <p>ϧ</p>
  <p>Without risk, there is no growth</p>
  <p>Φ</p>
  <p>
    The lessons have been incredibly deep and profound and have changed me
    forever
  </p>
  <p>π</p>
  <p>
    Stop crying about it already and find the silver lining to the mounting pile
    of corpses
  </p>
  <p>α</p>
  <p>And of course that box in its crudest clearest sense is her vagina</p>
  <p>Ϭ</p>
  <p>
    Some try and go back to where it was before the disruption, some flow and
    thrive and are able to co-create a better world, others get stuck in
    sadness, depression and doom multiplying on the coffee table silver lining

    I fear to let go of the tight grip I have on multiple locked vessels within
    me. A woman is not allowed to become hysterical. Keep a lid on it and all
    that
  </p>
  <p>Φ</p>
  <p>
    An opening up of something that cannot be put back to the way it was before,
    but an opening up of what? Something tremendous most likely, layers upon
    layers of new energies, experiences and emotions that perhaps we weren’t
    ready for
  </p>
  <p>Ϯ</p>
  <p>
    Is that the doorbell? If it’s your bad news letter, don’t open it. It’s in
    an email about the SECRET of how to lower your blood sugar. It’s in a vial
    in a lab, quivering. Put a lid on it. This message seems dangerous. It’s
    buried treasure. Similar messages were used to steal people’s personal
    information. Is there truly a difference between inside and outside?
  </p>
  <p>Ϸ</p>
  <p>
    With Pandora’s act, layers of complexity are added to the world. Human
    becoming is initiated by the loss of innocence; the contours of the self are
    known not just through love and joy, but also through suffering and illness
  </p>
  <p>ϧ</p>
  <p>The unknown box is also the knower and the process of knowing</p>
